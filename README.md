# game_of_recommend
this is a game of recommend, user, item and `interest` are generated from text corpus. we use this to demonstrate how recommend system machine learning model works

we recommend word, just like sug, and we use two word to represent a user.

the key aim of this project is to write a guide for recommend problem using tensorflow. NOT FORGET.

the first word of two user words will be a observed feature for recommend system, just like a generalized feature.

a AB test will be used for at most two recommend strategy
